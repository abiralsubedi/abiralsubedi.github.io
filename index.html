                        Welcome to my portfolio! I am Abiral Subedi, currently immersed in the dynamic world of software
                        development as a graduate student pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Old Dominion
                        University. Presently, I am on an enriching journey as a Software Developer Intern at Map
                        Communications, where I am honing my skills in preparation for graduation.

                    <p class="lead">
                        My passion for technology ignited during my formative years in Hetauda, Nepal. It all began with
                        a curiosity-driven exploration of web development basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – which I
                        delved into beyond the classroom confines. This early fascination laid the groundwork for a
                        rewarding career path ahead. Over the past four years, I have navigated the intricate landscape
                        of software engineering, with a
                        primary focus on full-stack web development. My academic pursuits have been complemented by
                        practical experiences, including a role as a Research Assistant at the Hands-on Lab for the
                        Department of Computer Science, where I've been involved in cutting-edge projects at the
                        intersection of academia and industry.

                    <p class="lead">
                        My professional journey took flight with a pivotal internship at Rigo Technologies during my
                        undergraduate studies. Here, I imbibed invaluable insights into efficient coding practices and
                        embraced the vibrant ethos of collaborative innovation. Subsequently, my role at Innovate Tech
                        further enriched my skill set, as I tackled diverse challenges spanning front-end and back-end
                        development realms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        At Innovate Tech, my responsibilities crystallized around an Ed Tech learning platform, My
                        Second Teacher, where I spearheaded the creation of responsive, interactive user interfaces and
                        highly performant REST APIs. Noteworthy projects included crafting a real-time chat application
                        using socket.io and leveraging serverless lambda functions to generate progressive PDF reports
                        for users. Collaborating closely with data scientists, I gained a nuanced understanding of
                        statistical techniques and machine learning models, facilitating the evaluation of student
                        learning gaps through mastery reports.

                    <p class="lead">
                        My journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence, coupled with a fervent
                        dedication to continuous learning. Whether collaborating with Quality Assurance teams to
                        implement automated testing frameworks or embracing emerging technologies, each experience has
                        propelled me closer to my goal of becoming a versatile technologist poised to make meaningful
                        contributions in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
